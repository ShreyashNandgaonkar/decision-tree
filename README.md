# Decision-tree
A decision tree is one of most frequently and widely used supervised machine learning algorithms that can perform both regression and classification tasks.
Advantages
Decision trees can be used to predict both continuous and discrete values i.e. they work well for both regression and classification tasks.
They require relatively less effort for training the algorithm.
They can be used to classify non-linearly separable data.
They're very fast and efficient compared to KNN and other classification algorithms.
